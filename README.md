# htauth

**htauth** generates encrypted passwords for basic and digest authentication.

It's similar to Apache support programs [*htdigest*][htdigest] and [*htpasswd*][htpasswd]. However, **htauth** is much more simpler and focus only in generate encrypted passwords to standard output.

## Installing

[Download][] and put the binary somewhere in your path.

### Building from source

    git clone http://github.com/jweslley/htauth
    make

## Options

* **-h string** Hashing encryption for passwords. Available hashing algorithms: bcrypt, sha1, plain. (default "bcrypt")
* **-r string** The realm name to which the user name belongs. Used only to generate passwords for digest authentication.

## Usage

In order to generate an encrypted password, just execute the command below:

    htauth <username>

You will be prompted to inform your password and the encrypted password will be printed.

To save the encrypted password, redirect the output to a file:

Encrypted passwords for digest authentication can be generated by using the `realm` option:

    htauth -r avengers.com stark > /path/to/htdigest
